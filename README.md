# Pets Activity Chart (Learning Project)

This repository was created in 2023 as part of my React learning.  
It is a simple **data visualization project** that uses the `react-google-charts` library to display pet activities in a pie chart.

## About
- Built with **React**, **JavaScript (ES6)**, and `react-google-charts`  
- Features:
  - Pie chart with sample data ("Daily Activities of Pets")  
  - Custom colors, legend, and tooltips  
  - Interactive: hovering over a legend item or chart slice highlights the corresponding part  
- Styled with basic CSS for layout  

## Status
- **Type:** Learning / training project  
- **Created:** 2023  
- **Maintenance:** Not actively maintained (kept as a reference)  

## Why Keep It?
I keep this repository as part of my learning journey.  
It shows my first experiments with:
- Setting up a **React** project  
- Using an external charting library (`react-google-charts`)  
- Rendering and customizing a dynamic pie chart component
